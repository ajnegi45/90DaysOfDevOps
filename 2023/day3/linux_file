Some file creating command and editors

touch file_name  (command to just create a file)

cat file_name   (command to read any file but cant modify it)

cp source_file_path destination_file_path  (command to copy a file to another location)

mv source_file_path destination_path  command to move a file from one place to another this is just like cut paste)

vim file_name    (command to read, write and modify the file if user has the permision to do)
in vim editor there are some steps to edit, save and exit
* once vim command will run we are inside the file we have to use " i " to insert any thing in file
* now if editing is completed then press " esc " to exit from insert mode
* now if you want to come out of file press " :q " or if you want to save the file also use " w " like, " :qw "

if you feel uncomfortable in vim you can also use 
nano file_name  (command to another file editor tool)
